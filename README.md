# Alt-Gr-Esperanto
Chrome extension typing Esperanto accented characters with the Alt Gr key

I've no idea how this will work with keyboards that don't have an AltGr key, but if your keyboard doesn't, try the key on the right of your spacebar. It's registerd as keyCode 18 on my keyboard. 

You can either build this yourself ([details here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en)) or download "Chrome Extension Files.crx" then in Chrome, open Settings > Extensions and drag the "Chrome Extension Files.crx" into the window area. 

If testing goes well, I will upload to the the chrome extensions web store.
